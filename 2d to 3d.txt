To make an image from 2D to 3D 

you need a JPG image and also a depth file .dat

steps to be followed:

Step 1: Convert 2D pixel into 3D points

f	0	Cx	0
0	f	Cy	0
0	0	1	0

y/Y=f/z
Y=y/f*z-Cy.z
(x,y) -> [x,y,z]

f = focal length 524
Image Resolution = 640 (w) x 480 (h)
offset of x (Cx) = 316
offset of y (Cy) = 256

Step 2: Generate Extrinsics (Ex)
R = Rotation (oritentation)
T = Translation (position)

R	T
0	1

Data3D â€“ new = Ex * Data3D

Step 3: Rander Virtual Image 
K(Intrisics) * 3D_new
